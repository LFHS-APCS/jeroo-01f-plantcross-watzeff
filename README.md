In Jeroo.java, write the method ```plantCross()``` that will plant flowers around the cross as shown in the pictures below.  The Jeroo will start at (0,0) facing EAST.

You should be using helper methods.  Do NOT put all the code inside of ```plantCross()```.

IMPORTANT:  You can only use:
* ```hop()```
* ```plant()```
* ```turn(LEFT)```
* ```turn(RIGHT)```

If using the https://jeroo.org web site, then your Main program will look like:  
```
      method main() {  
        Jeroo kim = new Jeroo(0, 0, EAST, 100);  
        kim.plantCross();  
      }
```
